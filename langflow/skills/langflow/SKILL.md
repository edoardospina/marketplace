# What is Langflow?

Langflow is an open-source, Python-based, customizable framework for building AI applications. It supports important AI functionality like agents and the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and it doesn't require you to use specific large language models (LLMs) or vector stores.

The visual editor simplifies prototyping of application workflows, enabling developers to quickly turn their ideas into powerful, real-world solutions.

Langflow can help you develop a wide variety of AI applications, such as chatbots, document analysis systems, content generators, and agentic applications.

Langflow includes several pre-built templates that are ready to use or customize to your needs.
